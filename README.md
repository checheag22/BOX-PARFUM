This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Shopify integration (future)

The app uses a simple catalog adapter in `services/catalog.ts` with a feature flag:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CATALOG_SOURCE=mock
```

Set it to `shopify` to route calls through `services/shopifyAdapter.ts` (stubs only today).

When connecting the Storefront API, add:

```
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ENDPOINT=https://your-shop.myshopify.com/api/2024-01/graphql.json
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN=your_storefront_access_token
```

Then implement the mapping in `services/shopifyAdapter.ts` to return internal `Product` models.
